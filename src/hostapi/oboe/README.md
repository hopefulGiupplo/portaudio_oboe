# Portaudio implementation for android using Oboe.

In order to use this implementation correctly, be sure to include the "portaudio.h" and "pa_oboe.h"  
headers in your project.

Building:
----  
To build portaudio with Oboe, there are some necessary steps:
1) An android NDK is needed to crosscompile it. I used the version 25.1.8937393, which I found at https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads.
2) Clone the Oboe repository - just follow the steps detailed here: https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/main/docs/GettingStarted.md.
   Make sure to correctly link the NDK path in the Oboe build.
3) Set the CMake variable OBOE_DIR to the path of the cloned Oboe repository.

TODOs:
----  
- Testing. This implementation was non-extensively tested for VoIP calls and blocking streams - for  
  everything else, it should have a decent structure.

- Implementing onErrorAfterClose in a way that works, and checking the callback methods.

Misc
----  
### Latency and Sharing Mode:
Using LowLatency and SharingMode Exclusive is possible, but a function in  pa_oboe.h that sets said flags *is yet to be implemented*, so you'll have to manually set those properties in the  OboeEngine::OpenStream function.


### Audio Format:
If you need to select a specific audio format, you'll have to manually set it in PaOboe_OpenStream  by modifying the format selection marked with a *FIXME*.
I'm positive that automatic format selection is possible, but simply using  PaUtil_SelectClosestAvailableFormat will not get you anywhere.


### Buffer sizes:
Portaudio often tries to get approximately low buffer sizes, and if you need specific sizes for your  buffer you should manually modify it (or make a simple function that can set it). For your convenience,  there is a *FIXME* as a bookmark.


###  Device selection and/or switching mid-stream:
Device selection can be handled by a java/kotlin method that uses getDevices() in order to identify  which device to select. Switching mid-stream gives an oboe::Result::ErrorDisconnected, and you'll have  to stop, close and reopen the involved streams with an unspecified device (or a specific device if  you know its ID). This process is already implemented through the OboeEngine::restartStream method, used by the OboeEngine::write and OboeEngine::read functions.
